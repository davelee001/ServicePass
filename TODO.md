- [ ] **6. Correct on-chain expiry and merchant enforcement — P0 · Large**
  The contract compares `expiry_timestamp` with the Sui epoch number, while the app/tests use millisecond timestamps. Pick a consistent on-chain time source/unit. Also enforce voucher-to-merchant restrictions on-chain rather than trusting only QR payload checks.

- [ ] **7. Prove the full system on testnet — P1 · Large**
  After the integration fixes, deploy the contract to Sui testnet and exercise minting, transfer, expiry, redemption, duplicate attempts, and failure/retry behavior using the actual frontend and backend. Don’t move to mainnet until these flows pass.

- [ ] **8. Complete production security and operations readiness — P1 · Large**
  Review contract and API authorization with a security audit; protect admin signing keys; verify TLS, database/Redis backups and recovery, monitoring/alerts, and incident procedures. Then do a staged deployment with a rollback plan.
